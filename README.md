This code sets up a Flask web application that lets users identify dog breeds from images. Letâ€™s break it down step-by-step.

1. Imports:
You start by importing necessary libraries:

Keras and TensorFlow libraries for building, loading, and processing machine learning models.
Flask to create a web server that handles requests and responses.
Other utilities like os, numpy, and pandas for file handling, numerical operations, and data manipulation.

2. Initialize Flask App:

app = Flask(__name__)


3. Ensure Upload Directory Exists:

if not os.path.exists('uploads'):
    os.mkdir('uploads')

The app checks if an uploads directory exists. If not, it creates one. This directory is where uploaded images are temporarily stored.

4. Load Dog Breed Labels:

labels_dataframe = pd.read_csv(r'D:\ai ml\ai2\labels.csv')
dog_breeds = sorted(list(set(labels_dataframe['breed'])))
n_classes = len(dog_breeds)
class_to_num = dict(zip(dog_breeds, range(n_classes)))


This section:

Reads a CSV file containing dog breed names.
Creates a sorted list of unique dog breeds.
Maps each breed to a unique numeric ID using class_to_num, which will help in identifying breeds from predictions.


5. Define and Load Models:
You define two models: model1 for breed classification and model2 for feature extraction.

Model1: Classification Model
model1 = Sequential([
    InputLayer((3072,)),
    Dropout(0.7),
    Dense(120, activation='softmax')
])
model1.load_weights(r"D:\ai ml\ai2\predict.weights.h5")

This is a sequential neural network model:

Input layer: expects a feature vector of size 3072.
Dropout layer: used to prevent overfitting by randomly setting 70% of inputs to zero.
Dense layer: 120 neurons, one for each possible breed, with a softmax activation to output probabilities for each class.
The weights are loaded from a file called predict.weights.h5.

Model2: Feature Extraction Model
input_layer = Input(shape=input_shape)
preprocessor_resnet = Lambda(resnet_preprocess)(input_layer)
resnet50v2 = ResNet50V2(weights='imagenet', include_top=False, input_shape=input_shape, pooling='avg')(preprocessor_resnet)
preprocessor_densenet = Lambda(densenet_preprocess)(input_layer)
densenet = DenseNet121(weights='imagenet', include_top=False, input_shape=input_shape, pooling='avg')(preprocessor_densenet)
merge = concatenate([resnet50v2, densenet])
model2 = Model(inputs=input_layer, outputs=merge)
model2.load_weights(r"D:\ai ml\ai2\extd.weights.h5")

This model combines two pre-trained neural networks for feature extraction:

ResNet50V2 and DenseNet121 are deep networks trained on ImageNet, designed for extracting meaningful features from images.
Lambda layer: preprocessor_resnet and preprocessor_densenet preprocess the input image.
Concatenate layer: combines the feature vectors from both networks to get a more comprehensive feature representation.
The extracted features are then passed to model1 to classify the breed.

6. Helper Function: get_key:
def get_key(val):
    for key, value in class_to_num.items():
        if val == value:
            return key
    return "Unknown breed"

This function helps retrieve the breed name from a numeric code. It searches the class_to_num dictionary for a matching breed and returns the breed name.

7. Define Routes:
Homepage Route
@app.route('/')
def index():
    return render_template("index.html")

This route loads the homepage when users visit the root URL. It renders an index.html template, which would typically contain an interface for uploading images.

Prediction Route:
@app.route('/predict', methods=['POST'])
def upload():
    if 'images' not in request.files:
        return "No image uploaded", 400
    
    f = request.files['images']
    filepath = os.path.join('uploads', f.filename)
    f.save(filepath)
    
    # Process image and make predictions
    try:
        img = image.load_img(filepath, target_size=(331, 331))
        x = image.img_to_array(img)
        x = np.expand_dims(x, axis=0)

        extracted_features = model2.predict(x)
        y_pred = model1.predict(extracted_features)
        pred_code = np.argmax(y_pred, axis=1)[0]  # Extract single prediction code
        predicted_dog_breed = get_key(pred_code)

        return f"The classified Dog breed is: {predicted_dog_breed}"
    except Exception as e:
        return f"An error occurred during prediction: {str(e)}", 500

The /predict route handles breed prediction:

Upload Image: Checks for the uploaded image, saves it to the uploads folder.
Image Preprocessing: The image is resized to (331, 331) pixels and converted to a format compatible with the models.
Feature Extraction: model2 extracts features from the image.
Classification: model1 takes these features as input and predicts the breed. The argmax function finds the most likely breed based on probabilities.
Mapping to Breed Name: Uses get_key to map the numeric prediction to the actual breed name.
Return Result: Sends back the breed name as a response.

8. Run the Application:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True, port=5001, use_reloader=False)

This code block runs the Flask app on localhost at port 5001. use_reloader=False prevents the app from restarting unnecessarily, especially when running within certain IDEs.
